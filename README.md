# Neutron production and interaction in an ITER-like tokamak
This project simulates, by using the software Geant4, the production of neutrons and the Tritium breeding phenomenon in a very simplified tokamak model inspired from ITER.
The project aims to obtain an estimate of the Tritium Breeding Ratio (TBR).
This parameter is defined as the ratio between number of tritium nuclei produced per neutron generated by nuclear fusion.
To study the breeding phenomenon a blanket inspired from the real ITER Test Breeding Modules (TBM) has been implemented in the Construction.cc file.

The tokamak is designed as a series of toroidal and cylindrical shapes which exemplify the layers and materials used in ITER, for example the $`1^{st}`$ wall and the central solenoid.
The neutrons are produced by a toroidal source in the center of the tokamak and have an energy of 14.1 MeV.

Here is a generic explanation of the source files used:
- main.cc: file containing the int main() function which starts the simulation;
- Construction.hh/cc: implementation of the geometry of the simulation;
- PhysicsList.hh/cc: implementation of the physics of the simulation (EM, neutron reactions...);
- NeutronHPphysics.hh/cc: specific file for neutron physics, taken from the Geant4 example Hadr04;
- PrimaryGeneratorAction.hh/cc: definition of particles generation;
- Detector.hh/cc: define the "detector" of the simulation, in this case the tritium breeding blanket, which detects tritium generation events;

To build the project on Linux:
```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
./Tokamak_Breeding.exe
```

The simulation can also be run without graphics and with the custom run.mac file:
```
./Tokamak_Breeding.exe run.mac
```
